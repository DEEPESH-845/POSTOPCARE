## Database Models

### RecoveryPlan Model
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  surgeryId: ObjectId (ref: SurgeryOnboarding),
  surgeryType: String,
  totalDays: Number,
  currentDay: Number,
  daysCompleted: Number,
  overallProgress: Number,
  timeline: [RecoveryDay],
  startDate: Date,
  estimatedEndDate: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### RecoveryDay Schema
```javascript
{
  dayNumber: Number,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  activities: [String],
  status: String (completed/current/upcoming),
  completedAt: Date
}
```

## AI Integration

The system uses DeepSeek AI to generate personalized recovery plans:

- **Model**: deepseek-chat
- **Purpose**: Generate medically accurate recovery timelines
- **Fallback**: Default recovery plans for common surgeries if AI fails
- **Input**: Surgery category, specific procedure, additional details
- **Output**: Structured recovery timeline with daily activities

## Progress Calculation

The system automatically calculates progress based on:
1. Surgery date from the surgery onboarding data
2. Current date
3. Total recovery days (AI-generated)

Progress includes:
- Current day in recovery
- Days completed
- Days remaining
- Overall progress percentage

## Status Types

Each day in the recovery timeline has one of three statuses:
- **completed**: Days that have passed
- **current**: Today's activities
- **upcoming**: Future days in the recovery plan

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid surgery IDs
- Unauthorized access
- Existing recovery plans
- AI generation failures (with fallback plans)
- Database connection issues

## Usage Flow

1. User completes surgery onboarding
2. User calls `/recovery/createplan` with surgery ID
3. System generates AI-powered recovery plan
4. Plan is automatically updated daily based on progress
5. User can retrieve updated plan anytime
6. Future: User completes daily check-ins to update progress

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Create recovery plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/recovery/createplan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"surgeryId": "YOUR_SURGERY_ID"}'

# Get recovery plan
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/recovery/plan/YOUR_SURGERY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Notes

- Each surgery can only have one recovery plan
- Plans are automatically updated based on the passage of time
- The AI generates medically appropriate timelines for different surgery types
- Default fallback plans are available if AI generation fails
- All endpoints require authentication
- Progress is calculated automatically based on surgery date vs current date
